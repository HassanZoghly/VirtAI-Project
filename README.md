## **🚀 Quickstart Guide**

### 1. Prerequisites
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Python 3.11+
- PostgreSQL & Redis (if running locally without Docker)

### 2. Setup
Clone the repository and set up your environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your specific OPENAI_API_KEY and connection strings
```

### 3. Running the Application
Using Docker Compose is the easiest way to get started:
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
```
This will spin up the database, Redis, the backend FastAPI server, and the frontend.

### 4. Running Tests
To ensure the system is healthy and everything is working, run the test suite using our provided script:
```bash
./backend/scripts/run_tests.sh
```
*Note: You may safely ignore `locust` module errors during standard test runs, as they are designated for specific load testing environments.*

To run the tests, you need to install locust. You can do this by running the following command:
```bash
pip install locust
```
